# Bikesharing
Using Tableau to analyze NYC Bikeshare data.

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this project is to see if the bike rental business is worth investing in for Des Moines. One of the key factors that needs to be reviewed is with regards to tripduration.  Using the Citibike share data, we can find out how long the bike trips have been in the month of August to provide us with a good analysis on when the bikes are rented, how long they are rented and what times are the most popular times to rent a bike. 

## Results:
Several different types of visualizations were created using Tableau that took into accout the total number of bike rides, the different types of users, and the duration of each bike trip.

    *There were a total of 2,344,224 bike trips in the month of August
    *Nearly 2 million subscribers and over 400,000 pay per use customers completed the trips in August
    *Nearly 150,000 bikes were used for atleast 5 minute rides
    *Largest demographic of users were male with high usage peaks during the week day; females did not register a very high peak time
    *Highset peak times were during the "rush hour" commute, 8am-9am and 5pm-7pm.
    *Male and Female subscribers had peak usage on Thursdays during the month of August.
    *The visualization details can be reviewed via the link below:

## Summary
After finalizing the visualizations, there was one day that did stand out with regards to usage.   Thursdays seem to be a heavy usage day for all subscribers.    Customers tended to spike more on the weekends.  Recommendation is for investors to review additional data with regards to usage during colder months of the year (dependent on location) and with regards to distance between user home/work location and the closests bike docking station.    This may open up new options to perhaps move some stations closer to other areas dependent on the usage.   Investors would see a benefit to opening such an endeavor in another city as it is a fast and healthy mode of transportation and feeds into the growing trend of healthy eco-friendly living.
